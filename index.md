**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Lots of the graph-ml stuff has been really interesting to me since it is a topic I haven't touched before. Quite frankly my favorite part is learning about the gaps where ML could come in and help since it really gets me thinking about what I could try to solve those problems.  
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Problem: Partition subgraphs to be representative of data during batch processing
Motivation: Finding faster ways to train a graph neural network by finding representative subgraph partitions that can help with memory constraints and compute costs when working with large graphs.
Techniques: Partitioning, Centrality algorithms
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Our quarter 1 project is mostly based around our learning of SOC's, I think I would mostly just mess around with learning how to split our data properly for train/test properly since data leaks are very very easy to occur. For what we are currently using it, routing demand there isn't necessarily a concern of data leaks but for a different task I can see it being difficult.   
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Trying to learn more about SOC's since right now I can feel a glaring knowledge with them, I understand the basics I think but anytime I go slightly deeper I struggle with my understanding of them.
